Data (Values):

Text values (e.g., in WHERE conditions) are usually case-sensitive by default, 
depending on the collation settings of the database.
For example, WHERE name = 'John' will not match 'john' unless case-insensitivity is specified 
(e.g., with ILIKE in PostgreSQL, or using a case-insensitive collation).
